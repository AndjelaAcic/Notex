Metamask API
Metamask API is a JavaScript API that allows developers to interact with the Metamask browser extension. Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to securely store and manage their Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens.
The Metamask API provides a set of methods that developers can use to interact with Metamask from their web applications. These methods allow developers to request permission from the user to access their Metamask wallet, retrieve account information, and send transactions to the Ethereum network.

Some examples of the methods available through the Metamask API include:

*ethereum.enable(): requests permission from the user to access their Metamask account
*ethereum.selectedAddress: retrieves the user's currently selected Ethereum address
*ethereum.sendTransaction(): sends a transaction to the Ethereum network from the user's account
Developers can use the Metamask API to build decentralized applications (dApps) that can interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the user's Metamask wallet. This allows for seamless and secure integration of cryptocurrency transactions into web applications.
