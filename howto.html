                    <p class="lead my-4"> <!--class lead for bigger text, my4 margin on y axis 4-->
                        One of the most unique features of Notex is its use of blockchain technology. This means that all transactions on the platform are transparent and secure, with users able to trust in the integrity of the system. By using Notex coins, students can easily exchange value with one another, making it a simple and efficient way to compensate others for their work.
                      </p>

                      <p class="lead my-4"> <!--class lead for bigger text, my4 margin on y axis 4-->
                        Decentralization is a key feature of many modern services, and it's no different for Notex. By using blockchain technology, Notex is able to offer users a fully decentralized platform that operates independently of any central authority. This means that users benefit from a high degree of transparency, security, and reliability, as all transactions on the platform are verified by a network of users rather than a single entity. 
                       </p>

                       <p class="lead my-4"> <!--class lead for bigger text, my4 margin on y axis 4-->
                        All files are stored on the blockhain using IPFS protocol so you will never need to worry about your intellectual property being stored on an centralized server.
